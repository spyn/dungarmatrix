Err - the pluggable chatbot
===========================

*Err is a GPL3-licensed chat-bot designed to be easily deployable, extensible
and maintainable. Our goal is to make it easy for you to write your own plugins
so you can make it do whatever you want.*

Simple to build upon
--------------------

Extending Err and adding your own commands can be done by creating a plugin, which
is merely a Python module containing a class derived from
:class:`~errbot.botplugin.BotPlugin`::

    from errbot import BotPlugin, botcmd

    class HelloWorld(BotPlugin):
        """Example 'Hello, world!' plugin for Err"""

        @botcmd
        def hello(self, msg, args):
            """Say hello to the world"""
            return "Hello, world!"

By default, Err looks at your docstrings to automatically document commands for the
built-in :ref:`\!help <builtin_help_function>` command. It will use the class' docstring as the description of
your plugin and use the method docstrings as documentation for the bot commands.

Batteries included
------------------

We aim to give you all the tools you need to build the bot you want, without
having to worry about basic functionality. As such, Err comes with a wealth of
features out of the box.

Sharing
-------

One of the principal goals of Err is to make it easy to not only create your own
plugins with little effort, but to make it easy to share them with others as well.

Err features a built-in *repositories command* (`!repos`) which can be used to
install, uninstall and update plugins made available by the community. Making your
plugin available through this command only requires you to publish it as a publicly
available Git repository and letting us know the URL so we can add it.

Currently, we're also working on a web interface lightly inspired by Hubot's
`script catalog <http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/>`_, which should make
this process even easier in the future.
