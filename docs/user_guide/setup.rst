Setup
=====

Prerequisites
-------------

Err runs under Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.2+ on Linux, Windows and Mac.

You need to have registered a user for the bot to use on the XMPP or IRC server that
you wish to run Err on. A lot of plugins use multi user chatrooms (MUC) as well, so
it is recommended (but not required) to have a least one MUC for Err to use as well.

Installation
------------

Err may be installed directly from PyPi using `pip` (`easy_install` works too) by issuing::

    pip install err

Or if you wish to try out the latest, bleeding edge version::

    pip install https://github.com/gbin/err/archive/master.zip

However, in these cases, installing into a dedicated `virtualenv`_ is recommended.

On some distributions, Err is available as a package via your usual package manager.
In these cases, it is generally recommended to use your distribution's package instead
of installing from PyPi.

Extra dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

requirements.txt lists only the bare minimum list of dependencies needed to run Err.
Depending on the backend you choose, additional requirements need to be installed.

For the XMPP based backends you must also install::

    sleekxmpp
    pyasn1
    pyasn1-modules
    dnspython3  # dnspython for Python 2.7

For the IRC backend, you must install::

    irc

Configuration
-------------

After installing Err, you must create a data directory somewhere on your system where
config and data may be stored. Find the installation directory of Err, then copy the
file :download:`config-template.py` to your data directory as *config.py*

Read the documentation within this file and edit the values as needed so the bot can
connect to your chosen XMPP or IRC server.

Starting the daemon
-------------------

The first time you start Err, it is recommended to run it in foreground mode. This can
be done with::

    <path_to_install_directory>/scripts/err.py

In many cases, just typing err.py will be enough as it is generally added to the PATH
automatically. Please pass -h or --help to err.py to get a list of supported parameters.
Depending on your situation, you may need to pass --config or --backend when starting
Err.

If all that worked, you can now use the -d (or --daemon) parameter to run it in a
detached mode::

    <path_to_install_directory>/scripts/err.py --daemon

If you are going to run your bot all the time then using some process control system
such as `supervisor`_ is highly recommended. Installing and configuring such a system
is outside the scope of this document however.

Hacking on Err's code directly
------------------------------

It's important to know that as of version 2.0, Err is written for Python 3. In order
to run under Python 2.7 the code is run through 3to2 at install time. This means that
while it is possible to run Err under Python 3.2+ directly from a source checkout, it
is not possible to do so with Python 2.7. If you wish to develop or test with Err's
code under 2.7, you must run::

    python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can also look into the `--editable` parameter of pip install.
